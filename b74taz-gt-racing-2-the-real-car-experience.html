Hey /r/AndroidGaming I'll be doing a livestream this Friday (Nov 8th) at 2PM PST of our upcoming simulation racer GT Racing 2: The Real Car Experience. It's been in a soft-launch for a little while now but I wanted to give everyone a chance to check out the gameplay and some of the cool features we are excited about. The stream will run for about an hour or two and I'll be doing giveaways like games, in-game currency and to top it all off I'll be giving away a new Nexus 7. I'll include I wrote the following in response to a comment about how to choose the right sports car. It ended up turning into a love story of how I ended up in a GT3. If you're interested in a long read about my journey, please enjoy. :) For my part. back in 2010 or 2011 or so I decided that I really wanted a roadster. I've always loved driving and spent my 20's in the sport compact modified car scene. By then though my car (Sunfire GT) had been sitting in my garage. Over the past couple years, I've become a big fan of Motorsport racing games. I've always enjoyed kart and arcade racers, but never really got into the more serious games and sims until relatively recently. Driving through some of these games most beautiful tracks has got me thinking and wishing that there was just a little more fantasy involved. I understand that the general audience for these serious racers want things realistic, they want to race on real tracks with real cars, I enjoy. So, A couple of days ago I posted about a VHS tape that I received but a spam bot had to go and fuck everything up (not the nosleepbot). So now no one commented on my post to help because it was archived or whatever. I had to do it on my own which was bullshit. I had no experience in codes or anything. Anyway, angry text wall out of the way here’s today's post. I packed up my TV and VCR, putting the VHS tape in my room and called my friend over to come and hang out. My friend Welcome to the /r/WEC Town Hall. We haven’t done one of these properly in a while, so we thought it’d be a good chance to slot one in before the European season starts in earnest. --- --- #The Sub ##Culture One thing I am constantly amazed by is the culture that has been built here at /r/WEC. The community here has proven to be continually open, welcoming and informative to new members despite large bursts of growth that occur as a function of being a sub that revolves around a sporting seaso. 
 So I'm writing a book about a racing driver and he meets a driver whose family is from Nigeria, however he's born and raised in Peckham, London. I wanted some help in regards to how Nigerian families name their children. For example, Russians always have the middle names of their children be the father's name followed by some suffix depending on if the child is a boy or a girl. Are there any fixed traditions for Nigerians? As for the names themselves, since you lot are bound I'll start right away by stating that I'm not 100% sure if this is against the rules to start a topic of discussion like this, as it is directly related to sim racing but I understand if this gets flagged by mods. I am really not trying to ignite a flame war, this is just something I am rather passionate about as an all around motorsports lover since I was 5 years old. Alright, that being said. I love racing. I love cars, I love motorsports and I love sim racing. Developer Minolin forum post: With the 6th update, we will introduce many interesting additions (besides the iconic Monza Circuit and both Nissan GT-R Nismo GT3s), but it will also be the first public version based on the significant changes and refactoring we decided to go for back in December. You will for sure notice small enhancements such as improved camera features, up to possible game changers like the radar widget, performance gains and massively improved overall stability. Translated from: https://www.ultimouomo.com/formula-1-superlicenza-piloti-paganti/ (https://www.ultimouomo.com/formula-1-superlicenza-piloti-paganti/) with www.deepl.com/translator (https://www.DeepL.com/Translator) In the definition of the starting grid of the new season of Formula 1 2019, now imminent, has come to create one of the most blatant cases of recent years regarding the weight of the influence that may have economic conditions on the rise of a Formula 1 driver. Lawre. I’ll be honest, I’m not 100% sure how this works in real racing with real race cars but after playing some Raceroom experience lately I noticed the game has very aggressive off throttle deceleration. Setting the differential braking power seems to make a trivial difference. It took me some time to get used to but now that I am I actually love it. You can make many turns through proper downshifting, decelerating, and an optimal line without even needing the brakes. It just feels so smooth. Hi everyone, I've been a Forza enthusiast for more than a decade. I've played the series for thousands of hours. Even though Forza Motorsport 7 was a disappointment in the early days of its release, it has become a much better game with time thanks to frequent updates, content and features, to the point that I enjoy it on a daily basis. But it's by no means perfect. There are so many things people would enjoy to be in the game (more cars, more tracks, better online experience, car sounds. Hi all, I've recently started playing Assetto Corsa. I must preface this with the fact that I don't drive in the real life, so I have little experience with steering a real car. I have purchased a VR setup and I have a Thrustmaster T-GT. I'm not sure how to use the pedals well. I don't wear shoes with them, is that an issue? They are fairly stiff and they seem to be at a very steep angle. However, if I move the pedals so far away that my legs are almost straight, they are fine. This was, I think, the chapter many people were anticipating, specifically the reveal of a certain character. Overall, this was pretty light on romance and more focused on character development. There were a few moments that need addressing but nothing too bad. This will be more a basic plot synopsis, a breather for myself after the chaos of the previous chapter. Alright. Let us get underway. CHAPTER 3: A Bad Girl Romance The chapter begins and Isabel.
